        + Add a bullets property (CCArray of Bullet instances) 
          (in GameLayer A.T.M. :/)
        + Add health, stength and more properties ... (think about it)

    + Add more screens:
        + StartScreen, GameScreen, ScoreScreen/EndScreen?  (think about it)

    + Display player score and health
    + Optimize code! *(**IMPORTANT!**)*


+ Build the an Android project   (doesnt work on Windows A.T.M.)
